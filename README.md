# Battleship-game
School project - subject Web Design

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. 
This project is made for school subject Web Design, and because of that it's only front-end project.

Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is different (there are 4 ships size of 1 field, 3 ships size of 2 fields, 2 ships size of 1 field and 1 ship size of 4 fields). The ships cannot overlap or touch horizontally nor vertically.
After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds. Each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. Computer announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, computer announces the size of ship that sank. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
